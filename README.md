application up and running.

This application is build a created a shortened link for given URL.


- I started by writing system spec to get homepage, form and creation of record.

- Than I wrote model spec and methods for genrating slug, sanitizing urls to avoid duplicacy.

- Than I wrote method to redirect user and getting stats around a shortened URL.

- Add more test and fix pending test
